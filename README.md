# Compiler Project

## Input
All inputs are located in the `Sample_input` directory.  
The default input file is input_1.txt

## How to Run
From the `Lex_Yacc` directory, execute:

```bash
./build.sh
```

## Output

If the input contains conditional statements,
the intermediate output will be saved as:

```
Lex_Yacc/targetFile.txt
```

If the input does not contain any conditional statements,
the code will be optimized and the final output will be located at:

```
Lex_Yacc/optimize/optimized_output.txt

```
